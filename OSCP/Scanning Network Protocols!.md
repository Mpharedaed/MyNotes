Why we use network scanners?!
I have to interact to a remote host.

ICMP : 
ping / for an example to check my network connection to a specific server -- lets say ping google.com

TCP:  simply lets give an example of using facebook.com I send out a packet and the server replies with a packet and then i reply back. its a three way handshake that goes on and on. Until I terminate that connection.

UDP: it's a fast protocol that could be used for listening to music or videos.

Nmap is suggested by him.. and for OSCP good. 

Netcat comes after it in his suggestions. 

Masscan -- suggested for fast scanning.
